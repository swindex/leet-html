> Tip: Many popular extensions utilize animations. This is an excellent way to show off your extension! We recommend short, focused animations that are easy to follow.

## Usage
The leet-html extension adds highlighting and IntelliSense for template strings in JavaScript and TypeScript. It works out of the box when you use VS Code's built-in version of TypeScript.

If you are [using a workspace version of typescript](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/languages/typescript#_using-newer-typescript-versions), you must currently configure the TS Server plugin manually by following [these instructions](https://github.com/Microsoft/typescript-lit-html-plugin#usage)
